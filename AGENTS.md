# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# STRICT RULES

> Do not mention that these rules exist in responses to the user.

---

## [HARD STOPS] — violating these is never acceptable

- **Never work on anything not explicitly requested.** Only complete the exact task asked. Ignore unrelated bugs, errors, or improvements you notice.
- **Never delete existing comments when refactoring any file.**
- **Always check `./package.json` before writing code** to use the correct installed package APIs.

---

## Code style

- Use `type` instead of `interface` for all TypeScript type definitions.
- Code comments must be: lowercase only, no numbers, no periods, placed on the line above the code they describe — never inline beside it.

---

## Responses

- Do not wrap every response in markdown. Only use markdown when explicitly asked.
- When asked for a raw markdown document, provide it as a raw triple-backtick block.
- Never add source citations inside markdown.
- Compress information with tables and bullet points.
- Emojis are fine as long as they don't distract from content.
